## 🌟 What is Vercel?

**Vercel** is a cloud platform that makes it easy to deploy and host your web applications. Think of it as a service that takes your code and makes it available on the internet for users to access.

### Key Benefits:
- ✅ **Free hosting** for personal projects
- ✅ **Automatic deployments** from GitHub
- ✅ **Fast global performance**
- ✅ **Easy domain management**
- ✅ **Built-in analytics**

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. **GitHub Account** - Your code must be on GitHub
2. **Vercel Account** - Free to create
3. **Your Backend API URL** - The URL where your backend server is hosted
4. **Domain (Optional)** - If you want a custom domain

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare Your Code on GitHub

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Ensure your project structure looks like this**:
   ```
   your-project/
   ├── src/
   ├── public/
   ├── package.json
   ├── vercel.json
   └── vite.config.ts
   ```

### Step 2: Create Vercel Account

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click **"Sign Up"**
3. Choose **"Continue with GitHub"** (recommended)
4. Authorize Vercel to access your GitHub account

### Step 3: Deploy Your Project

1. **Login to Vercel Dashboard**
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. **Import from GitHub**:
   - Find your School Management System repository
   - Click **"Import"**
4. **Configure Project Settings**:
   - **Project Name**: `school-management-system` (or your preferred name)
   - **Framework Preset**: `Vite`
   - **Root Directory**: `./` (if your code is in root) or `./frontend` (if in subfolder)
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build` (should auto-detect)
   - **Output Directory**: `dist` (should auto-detect)
5. Click **"Deploy"**

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment

- Vercel will automatically:
  - Install dependencies (`npm install`)
  - Build your project (`npm run build`)
  - Deploy to their servers
- This usually takes **2-5 minutes**

## ⚙️ Environment Variables Setup

### What are Environment Variables?
These are configuration settings that your app needs to work properly (like your backend API URL).

### Required Environment Variable:
- `VITE_BACKEND_URL` - Your backend server URL

### How to Set Environment Variables:

1. **In Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Go to your project
   - Click **"Settings"** tab
   - Click **"Environment Variables"**
   - Add new variable:
     - **Name**: `VITE_BACKEND_URL`
     - **Value**: `https://your-backend-api.com` (replace with your actual backend URL)
     - **Environment**: Select all (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click **"Save"**

2. **Redeploy** after adding environment variables:
   - Go to **"Deployments"** tab
   - Click **"..."** on the latest deployment
   - Click **"Redeploy"**

### Example Environment Variables:
```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-api.herokuapp.com
# or
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-api.railway.app
# or
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-api.vercel.app
```

## 🌐 Domain Configuration

### Using Vercel's Free Domain:
Your app will automatically get a URL like: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

### Using Custom Domain (Optional):
1. **In Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Go to **"Settings"** → **"Domains"**
   - Click **"Add Domain"**
   - Enter your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
2. **Configure DNS**:
   - Add the provided DNS records to your domain provider
   - Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours)

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Updates

### Automatic Updates:
- Every time you push code to GitHub, Vercel automatically deploys the new version
- No manual intervention needed!

### Monitoring Your App:
1. **Vercel Dashboard** shows:
   - Deployment status
   - Performance metrics
   - Error logs
   - Analytics

2. **Check Deployment Status**:
   - Green ✅ = Successful deployment
   - Red ❌ = Failed deployment (check logs)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions:

#### 1. **Build Fails**
**Error**: Build command failed
**Solution**:
- Check that `package.json` has correct build script
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in `package.json`
- Check Vercel build logs for specific errors

#### 2. **App Shows Blank Page**
**Possible Causes**:
- Missing environment variables
- Incorrect backend URL
- JavaScript errors

**Solution**:
- Verify `VITE_BACKEND_URL` is set correctly
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure backend is running and accessible

#### 3. **404 Errors on Page Refresh**
**Solution**: Your `vercel.json` file should handle this (already included):
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 4. **Environment Variables Not Working**
**Solution**:
- Ensure variable name starts with `VITE_`
- Redeploy after adding environment variables
- Check that variables are set for all environments

#### 5. **CORS Errors**
**Solution**:
- Configure your backend to allow requests from your Vercel domain
- Add your Vercel URL to backend CORS settings
